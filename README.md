## 🖥️ What is this?

This is my **minimal and customized Hyprland setup**, designed for a sleek and distraction-free workflow.

It includes the following components:

- 🔧 Modified **Hyprland** config
- 📊 Minimal and customized **Waybar**
- 🚀 **Rofi** application launcher
- 🎨 **Graphite Dark** GTK theme *(you might need to install + set it manually)*
- 💻 Custom **p10k** ZSH prompt
- 🔒 Configured **Hyprlock**
- 📟 Custom **Neofetch** (you may need to place the image manually)

---

## 📌 Requirements & Notes

- I installed **GNOME** alongside Arch — some apps might require it (latest version).
- Double-check all configs (filenames, locations, dependencies).
- Be patient — many packages are installed via `yay`.

---

## ✅ Apps I use

- **Waybar**, **hyprpaper**, **zen-browser**, **Deezer**, **Kitty**, **Obsidian**
- **Rofi**, **Nemo** (file manager), **Discord**, **VSCodium**, **Neovim**
- **Hyprlock**, **Hyprshot**

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure these are installed and properly configured:

- Wallpapers (should be in your `~/Pictures`)
- `arch-removebg-preview.png` for Neofetch (place in `~/Downloads`)
- Fonts: **Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font**
- Themes: **Graphite Dark GTK theme**, **Bibata Cursor**
- CLI tools: `neovim`, `zsh`, `git`, `yay`, `cava` *(optional)*
- Utilities: `nwg-look` (for GTK theming), `p10k` for shell prompt

---

## 🧠 To be added later

- A proper **power menu** (shutdown, reboot, lock…)
- **Waybar audio widget** *(currently handled manually via `pavucontrol`)*
- (Maybe) a dock — not sure it's necessary yet
